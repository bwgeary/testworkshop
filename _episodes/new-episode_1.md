In this lesson we will learn how to commercialise your code, "sharing" in exchange for money.


> ## Finding out `10 min`
> Consider which companies have the most money to provide to you
> Which is right for you?
>
> 1. Consider the different things you could do with the money
>   - New house
>   - New car
>   - Etc.
> 2. Perhaps the code is better in private hands than public. When has a private company ever done something wrong or immoral?
>
> 3. Once complete, start to conceptualise your next money grab
>
> ### Having doubts?
> Remember that money can make all your ethical issues just wash away
